This repository contains the codes for my Master's Thesis. 
The codes are divided into three main sections:

Codes for combining the two datasets (ERS and VMS), done for each year. Including data cleaning and selection of relevant variables, in addition to spatial and temporal filtering to fit the study requirements.

#### 02 Prework
Codes for combining all areas and years of data into one final dataset.

#### 03 Data Analyses
Codes for the data analyses performed, including descriptive statistics, and analyses addressing the three research objectives (RQ1, RQ2, RQ3).
